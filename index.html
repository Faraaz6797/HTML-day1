<!-- Difference between div and span -->
The <div> or the division element is a generic HTML element utilised to divide the web page contents into blocks.  
The block element of the pages begins a new line and is as wide as the entire page.
<!-- <span></span> -->
The <span> generic inline element is used to stylise text. It applies styling to a section of the inline content. The inline element does not use a new line and will only occupy as much space as the text.
    <!-- Difference between class and IDs -->
    
In Html both id and class are the element selector and are used to identify an element based on the name assign to these parameters.
<!-- id -->
In Html for an element ID name starts with the “#” symbol followed by a unique name assigned to it.
Only one ID selector can be attached to an element.
Id is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element
<!-- id="idDemo" -->
class assigned to an element has its name starts with “.” followed by class name.
Multiple class selectors can be attached to an element.
The class can be applied to multiple elements so it could be multiple times on a single page.
<!-- .classDemo -->

<!-- What are self closing tags -->
A self-closing tag in HTML is a kind of HTML tag that does not need to be closed manually by its closing tag,
which means it does not have a separate closing tag as </tag>. 
Some few self-closing tags are <input/>, <hr/>, <br/>, <img/>, etc

<!-- How many types of headings are there?How to decide which to use where  -->
HTML defines six levels of headings, and these heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6.
 The H1 element is the highest or most important level, and the H6 element is the least important.
  These different heading levels help to communicate the organization and hierarchy of the content on a page.
  They should be used in order from most important to least important.
 
  <!-- Difference between block and inline   -->
  Block elements: They consume the entire width available irrespective of their sufficiency.
   They always start in a new line and have top and bottom margins. 
  It does not contain any other elements next to it.

  Examples of Block elements:
  <!-- <h1>-</h6>,<div>,<hr>,<li><p> etc. -->

    Inline elements: Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline.
     Inline elements dont start from a new line and dont have top and bottom margins as block elements have.

     Examples of Inline elements:

     <!-- <a><img><b><label> etc -->

        <!-- Difference between em and strong -->

        The <em> tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

            The strong tag is one of the element of HTML used in formatting HTML texts.
             It is used to show importance of the text by making it bold or highlighting it semantically.

            Syntax: <strong> Contents... </strong>
